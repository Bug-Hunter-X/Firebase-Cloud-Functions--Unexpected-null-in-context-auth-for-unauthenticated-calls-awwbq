The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when using Cloud Functions and attempting to access the authentication context within an HTTPS Callable function. The error arises when the function is invoked without proper authentication, and the `context.auth` object is unexpectedly null instead of undefined.  This causes issues when trying to handle the null case, leading to runtime errors.

```javascript
// Uncommon Firebase Cloud Function Error
exports.myHttpsCallableFunction = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  if (!context.auth) {
    // This condition will not be met if context.auth is null instead of undefined
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'Unauthenticated user.');
  } 
  // ...Rest of your code accessing context.auth...  
});
```
